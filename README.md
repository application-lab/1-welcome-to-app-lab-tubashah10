# About Me
Hello! My name is Tuba Shah and I am currently a senior at NYU Shanghai. I spend my time reading newspaper articles about the current political scenario. I also enjoy watching tennis and cricket. I am majoring in Economics with a minor in Business and I intend to do politics in my home country, Pakistan, as my future career.
